I'm a Research Scientist at CBS-NTT Program in Physics of Intelligence, Harvard University. Currently my research focuses on understanding the generalization behaviors of AI.

I did a PhD in machine learning at the Kyoto University, supervised by Hisashi Kashima. During my PhD I primarily worked on temporal point processes (TPPs) â€” probabilistic models for continuous-time event sequences, such as user activity on social media.
