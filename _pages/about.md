I'm a Research Scientist at CBS-NTT Program in Physics of Intelligence, Harvard University. Currently my research focuses on understanding the generalization behaviors of AI. 

I did a PhD in machine learning at the Kyoto University, supervised by Hisashi Kashima. During my PhD I primarily worked on integrating deep learning with probabilistic models grounded in social science and physics, for continuous-time event sequences, such as user activity on social media and earthquake occurrences.  

If you want to learn more about my research, have a look at my [publications](/publications/).
