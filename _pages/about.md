I am currently a Research Scientist at the CBS-NTT Program in Physics of Intelligence at Harvard University, where my work is centered around understanding the generalization behaviors of generative AI models. My goal is to enhance our fundamental understanding of these powerful models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable AI.
Previously, I was a Research Scientist at NTT R&D, focusing on advanced time-series modeling techniques and their practical applications in crowd management, contributing to safer and more efficient public spaces.

I obtained my Master's degree in Physics at Tokyo University, where I collaborated on the ATLAS experiment at CERN, developing data analysis algorithms for the analysis of the Higgs boson. 
I did my PhD in Computer Science from Kyoto University. My doctoral research bridged deep learning with probabilistic modeling, grounded in principles from social science and physics. My doctoral research bridged deep learning and probabilistic modeling, drawing inspiration from principles in social science and physics, with applications ranging from analyzing user behavior on social media to modeling earthquake occurrences.
